# demofonts-shaping-docs
This repository is meant to contain the various binary font files that are used to build the demo illustrations in the opentype shaping documents repository.

As of today (July 2, 2025), it is here just as a test mechanism, to help determine if hosting the font files in a separate repo and adding that repo as a git submodule will result in a simpler build process for users needing to regenerate the illustrations locally.

It's an experiment; if it isn't useful, it will go away.

The licenses for each font may vary; they will be recorded in the repo LICENSE file, but be sure and read (or just consult their upstream homes, which may be better in the long run).
